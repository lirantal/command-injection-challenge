# Welcome to your first Command Injection lesson!

Hey there, and welcome to the Command Injection challenge  ðŸ‘‹!

In this lesson, the goal is to teach you how dangerous it can be to execute commands in a shell without proper security controls. You will learn how to exploit a vulnerable application by injecting commands into the shell.

## Your mission

Look at the provided `./api-timezon.js` file that would typically be used in a Node.js web application route to retrieve timezone information from a third-party remote service. The code is vulnerable to command injection, can you figure out a query payload that will execute a command on the server?

Happy hacking!

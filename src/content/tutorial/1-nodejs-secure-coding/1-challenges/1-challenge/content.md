## Can you hack me?

Hi there hacker, and welcome to your first Node.js security challenge üëã!

In this first challenge interaction, the goal is to demonstrate to developers how it may seem hard to exploit Node.js backend servers, yet very much possible!

### Your mission, should you choose to accept it

Look at the provided `./api-timezone.js` file that would typically be used in a Node.js web application route to retrieve timezone information from a third-party remote service.

There's a vulnerability in the code that allows attackers to... well, that's for you to find out, right?

Can you gain the backend secrets? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Happy hacking!
